# Kaggle Titanic Competition

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning competition.

## Overview

The Titanic competition is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset for this competition contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. It's divided into two sets: training set (with labels) and test set (without labels). The data is provided in CSV format.

## File Descriptions

- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing features and labels.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset containing only features.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Approach

I approached this problem using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook `titanic.ipynb` to see the data analysis and model building process.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

## Results

My final submission achieved an accuracy of X% on the Kaggle leaderboard.
